# Improving Type 2 Diabetes Risk Prediction with an XGBoost Model
This project develops a high-performance machine learning model to predict the onset of Type 2 diabetes using the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset. It utilizes a sophisticated XGBoost classifier integrated into a scikit-learn Pipeline, which handles advanced data imputation and feature scaling. The model is rigorously optimized through GridSearchCV to achieve the highest possible predictive accuracy, demonstrating a professional, end-to-end approach to solving a real-world classification problem.
